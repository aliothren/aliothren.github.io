I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Arizona. Before starting my PhD, I obtained dual Master’s degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, and in Sensing, Communicating and Big Data from EURECOM, France. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Automation from Xi’an Jiaotong University in 2020.

My research focuses on making deep learning more efficient and reliable. In particular, I am interested in:

- Efficient deployment and adaptation of neural networks and foundation models

- Designing AI algorithms suitable for system- and hardware-level deployment

- Developing systems and hardware accelerators to optimize AI workloads

I aim to bridge theory and practice by exploring both algorithm-level improvements and system-level optimizations, with the goal of enabling the practical and scalable use of modern AI models in real-world applications.

Feel free to reach out to me by email if you are interested in collaboration or discussing new ideas.
